# My Store

My Store is an Angular web application.  It uses an Express API with Postgres for the data feed.  This project is the result of a Full Stack JavaScript Developer training course.

Need to add:
    how to setup and connect to the database
    what ports the backend and database are running on
    package installation instructions
